Iris_Recogntion

For Running this Project, a new version of matlab is being used, R2012a will be okay. The only library used is image processing toolbox.
-Please don't change the data base's directories, we iterate over all the images using dir().
-The path to this library has been set in loopdir.m, you can change it here.
-please open loopdir.m and run the script, it will call other functions included in the project directory.
-At the end of the project, you can see the hamming distances of different images, if you open matrix X, you can see which images have been
selected as the same eye.
-For your convenience, we have provided percentage of false positive and false negative in the command window.
-For reducing the running time, we have used parallel for(), You can add it in the parallel menu, or it is very easy and you can change it
 back to normal for loop.
-If you have any questions running the project please let me know.
-At the end, project works fine without any logical and syntax errors.

Thank you.
